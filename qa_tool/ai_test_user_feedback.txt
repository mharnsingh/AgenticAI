Okay, here are 50 distinct customer feedback snippets, following the format you requested:
Feedback #1: I tried uploading a large PDF, and it just got stuck at the very end. It says 99% for ages!
Feedback #2: The search is useless when I look for things like "CEO". It just finds documents with the letters C, E, and O separately.
Feedback #3: Why are all the pictures in this document preview broken? It makes it impossible to understand.
Feedback #4: When I click on page 3 of the search results, it keeps taking me back to page 1. Very frustrating!
Feedback #5: On my phone, some of the buttons are overlapping each other. I can't even click the right one.
Feedback #6: I tried to filter documents from last month, but the list doesn't seem right. There are definitely documents missing.
Feedback #7: I'm not getting any email notifications when someone shares a document with me. I missed an important update!
Feedback #8: The file size shown for my uploads is all wrong. A 10MB file is showing as 10KB.
Feedback #9: I accidentally typed a really long search term, and the whole app seemed to freeze for a bit.

Feedback #20: The loading bar finished really quickly, but the task was still running in the background. It was confusing.
